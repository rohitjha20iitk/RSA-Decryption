Level you want to start at: [3;J[H[2J



	You are in a small chamber. Unlike the previous hall, this chamber seems 
	naturally formed -- the floor and walls are rocky and uneven. Was that hall
	and pool an illusion, you wonder. But then you notice a sign of human 
	(or whatever) work: that someone has fixed lighted torches in the walls 
	of the chamber, and these are providing ample light to see around. So you
	were not dreaming after all...

	You then notice that there are several exits from the chamber. You count
	five. And all but one of these exits have no doors! The exit with door has 
	a panel next to it and the door is closed. Going closer to an open exit, 
	you notice "Exit 2" written on the wall next to it.  Curious, you go around 
	and find that the exits are numbered from 1 to 5 in this fashion. The closed 
	exit is numbered 5 and the exit from which you came in is numbered 1.

	You travel through a twisted, narrow, and rocky passage that sometimes goes up, 
	sometimes down, sometimes left, and sometimes right. Sometimes you sense that other 
	passages are joining in, but can only make out one path and so follow it.
	Finally, you reach a chamber that has five exits, numbered one through five. 
	Exit numbered five is closed with a panel next to it. Remaining are open.

	You see the following written on the panel:

	You enter a narrow passage with very dim light.
	The passage is not very long, you can see the other
	exit in front of you.
	Feeling elated at having solved the puzzle, you pick up
	a stone and write your name on the wall.
	You notice names written all around:
		rootforcers Oracle AlphaBeta Cryptopedia CryptoBuddies 
		CAPSLOCK Kryptohunters CodeNymro Stuxnet PolkaDots 
		Cipherberg
